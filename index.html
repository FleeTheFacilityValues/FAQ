        <font size="5"><b><u>Who is mainly in charge of the value list?</u></b></font><br>
        The current value list holder and the person mainly in charge is Rox.<br>   
        <br>
        <font size="5"><b><u>How are values determined?</u></b></font><br>
        Values are determined by a group of experienced traders, usually called Value List Helpers or Helpers for short. The main methods of determining a set's value include: observing frequent offers for that set, analyzing how often the set is being sought after, conducting community votes, gathering community suggestions, and other evaluation methods.<br>
        <br>
        <font size="5"><b><u>Why do we only assign values to sets and not individual items?</u></b></font><br>
        We do not assign values to individual items from a set, commonly referred to as “brokens”, because there is no reliable or consistent way to determine their values. The range of offers for brokens varies too widely, making it impossible to establish accurate and consistent values.<br>
        <br>
        <font size="5"><b><u>How often does the value list update? Is there a specific schedule?</u></b></font><br>
        There is no specific schedule for updates. The value list is updated after reviewing all suggestions, conducting votes, and determining which changes will be implemented based on the results. In other words, updates are released randomly. However, they typically occur every 2 to 7 days.<br>
        <br>
        <font size="5"><b><u>Will there be official conversion rates to other games?</u></b></font><br>
        No, there will not be any conversion rates to other games.<br>
        <br>
        <font size="5"><b><u>How many List Helpers are there?</u></b></font><br>
        The team currently consists of <a href="members.html">6 members</a>, including the Value List Holder.<br>
        <br>
        <font size="5"><b><u>Is it possible to join the value list team?</u></b></font><br>
        Yes, it is possible to become a member of the team through applications that we occasionally open in the official AW Apps Discord server.<br>
        <br>
        <font size="5"><b><u>When do applications for Value List Helper open?</u></b></font><br>
        There is no set schedule for applications. They are opened only when we are looking for new members. If applications are currently open, you will find that information in the pinned messages within the <a href="https://www.discord.gg/awapps">AW Apps Discord</a> server, specifically in the trading channel.<br>
        <br>
        <font size="5"><b><u>Why are we reworking values?</u></b></font><br>
        To completely replace hunter values with a better & more stabilized value reference point, since hunters were not receiving a rise despite them getting more than their own value, so we look forward to improve the overall values of all the sets in game.<br>
        <br>
        <font size="5"><b><u>What is the new reference point?</u></b></font><br>
        A legendary set from Series 1 crate (any hammer + any gem can count as a set) that will be worth <u>1 value</u> in the new system. <br>
        <br>
        <font size="5"><b><u>Why exactly this reference point and not something else?</u></b></font><br>
        Series 1 legendaries can't rise because they're always going to be obtainable, and can't drop any lower than we're valuing them already, because it's simply not worth spending credits on them considering the years they've been out for.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Important details:</b><br>
        You might NOT always be able to trade a 4 value set for 4 crate legendary sets and the other way around. Those will pretty much only work as a value reference point and not be relevant in usual trading. We are NOT encouraging you to buy any items from permanent crates for the purpose of trading them.<br>
